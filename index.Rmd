  Welcome to home page of *Team 3* SMT201 Geographic Information Systems for Urban Planning project website. 
  
  This project aims to plan a new-province level city and to relocate the capital of Indonesia to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. To achieve that, the proposed project aims to analyze the geographical layout of specific regions in East Kalimantan to create a new province-level planned city. The goal of this strategy is to reduce developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago as well as to reduce Jakarta's burden as Indonesia's Primary hub. 
  
  Our team deployed a 2 pronge approach to this project where we will analyze the study area comprehensively and provide our recommendation in choosing a suitable relocation site on this project topic. Feel free to browse our reports and poster below!
