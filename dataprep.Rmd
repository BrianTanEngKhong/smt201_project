### <span style="text-decoration:underline">3.3 Merging layers</span>
Since we have data scattered in different folders (e.g. road shapefiles from Kota Balikpapan, Kota Samarinda and more), we will be merging them into one layer for a cleaner QGIS environment. The layers in the table in *section 3.2* should be merged as they are from the 4 different folders. 

+ From the top menu bar, select **Vector → Data Management Tools → Merge Vector Layers.**

![](img/3.jpg)

+ Under Input layers, click on the more icon at the end to select the layers in which you want to merge.
+ For destination CRS, select the **project CRS (EPSG:23845)**
+ Click on **Run**. 
+ A temporary merged layer will be created.
+ The temporary layer should be clipped *(section 2.3.4)* to remove all unnecessary points and then saved into GeoPackage format. 

> **Repeat** this process of merging for all the other necessary layers 

### <span style="text-decoration:underline">3.4 Clipping the various layers</span>
+ We will be clipping the layers as mentioned above so that points outside of east_kalimantan will be cleaned away to keep only the points and polygons within our study area. 

+ From the top menu bar, click on **Vector → Geoprocessing → Clip**

![](img/4.jpg)

+ For the Input layer, select from the drop down menu the layer in which we would like to clip. Note that all the layers merged in the previous section should be clipped.
+ Click on the spanner beside the Input layer and select from the drop down menu **Do not Filter (Better Performance).**

![](img/5.jpg)

+ For Limit features processed, select **Not set**
+ For Overlay layer, select **east_kalimantan.**
+ Click on the spanner beside the Overlay layer and select from the drop down menu **Do not Filter (Better Performance).**
+ Geopackage clipped layer and remove the temporary clipped layer and merged layers.

>**Repeat** this process of clipping for all the other necessary layers.

![](img/6.jpg)

+ Next, save the selected features into the GeoPackage and name the layer connectingRoads.

### <span style="text-decoration:underline">4.2 Airport buffer </span>

+ We will first dissolve our airport polygon layer as we do not want to create multiple buffer for scenarios like this where there are 3 different polygons representing 1 airport

![](img/7.jpg)

* Go to **Vector → Geoprocessing Tools → Dissolve**
    + For the input layer, we will select **Airport** 
    
![](img/8.jpg)

+ Click on **run**

+ We will have a layer called ‘Dissolved’. Save it to the Geopackage and rename it as **AirportDissolved**
+ Next, we want to create a buffer zone of 3.5km to airport for our accessibility to airport 
+ According to our research, a buffer zone of 3.5km from the airport zone will be used so as to minimize noise pollution in our proposed capital site. 
+ Using the AirportDissolved layer, we will create a 3.5km buffer 
* Go to Vector > Geoprocessing tools > Buffer
   + For the input layer, we will select **AirportDissolved**
   + Distance will be **3500 meters** or **3.5 kilometers** is also acceptable
   + Segments we will change to **100**
   + End cap style and Join style will be **Round** and Miter limit will be default at 2

![](img/9.jpg)

+ Click on **Run**

+ Save the Clipped(mask) layer into GeoPackage and change the resolution to **100m by 100m**.
+ Name it as **slopeStudyArea**.

## 6.0 Choosing a suitable site
### <span style="text-decoration:underline">6.1 Standardising the data using Z-Score</span>

We will be using **Raster calculator** to standardise the proximity layers. The following Z-score equation is used for standardisation.

![](img/formula.jpg)

To get the *minimum* and *maximum* values used for standardisation, **right click** on the particular proximity layer, **disaster_proxmity** and navigate to the **Information tab**. The *minimum* and *maximum* values can be found there.  

![](img/19.jpg)

+ From the top menu bar, click on **Process → Toolbox**
+ A side pane will appear on the right.
+ Double click on **Raster calculator**. 

![](img/20.jpg)

> Use the **standardisation equation** as mentioned above and key it into the **expression pane** as shown in the image below. 

![](img/21.jpg)

+ Click on the **Run** button and close the window
+ Export the layer as a GeoPacakge and name it **factor_disaster**. 

> **Repeat** this for all other proximity layers\
**Note** that for layers in which we want to be close to, we will inverse the standardisation using **(1 - Zvalue)**. After standardizing, we save the respective results as:

Layer to perform standardization | Inverse (1-Zscore) | Final Layer Name 
------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
disaster_proximity | No | factor_disaster_new
forest_proximity | No | factor_forest
hotspots_heatmap | Yes | factor_hotspot
seaport_proximity | Yes | factor_seaport
connectingRoads_proximity | Yes | factor_connectingRoad
airport_proximity | Yes | factor_airport
slope | Yes | factor_slope
settlement_proximity | Yes | factor_settlement

### <span style="text-decoration:underline">6.2 AHP calculation</span>

Using the Raster calculator, we will now calculate the composite factor score using the following AHP importance ranking and weights. Our team achieved a consistency score of *4%* and thus we will proceed with the following AHP weightage.

![](img/22.jpg)

![](img/23.jpg)

We created the AHP suitability layer with the following calculation: 

> ("factor_disaster_new@1" * 0.327) + 
("factor_forest@1"* 0.227) + ("factor_hotspot@1" * 0.157) + ("factor_seaport@1" * 0.108) + ("factor_connectingRoad@1" * 0.073) + ("factor_airport@1" * 0.05) + ("factor_slope@1" * 0.0340) + ("factor_settlement@1" * 0.024)

+ Our reference layer will be any one of the factor layers that we have 
+ Output CRS will be **EPSG:23845 – DGN95/Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1**

![](img/24.jpg)

+ Click on **Run** and close the dialogue box after a new temporary layer is created. 
+ Save the temporary layer as a GeoPackage and name it **AHP**.

![](img/25.jpg)


From our analysis we decided that a composite factor score of 0.4 should be used as a cut-off for suitable sites. Now, we will use the function **Reclassify by table** to separate the sites into suitable and not suitable. 

+ From the **Processing Toolbox**, search for **Reclassify by table** and double click on it.

![](img/26.1.jpg)

The dialogue box for Reclassify by table will appear.

+ Raster layer: **AHP**
+ Click on the more icon under Reclassification table and enter the following as shown below.

![](img/26.2.jpg)

+ Click **OK** to return to the previous screen
+ For range boundaries select: **min <= value < max**
Your dialogue box should look like the screenshot below

![](img/27.jpg)

+ Click on **Run** and close the dialogue box. 
+ Save this temporary Reclassified raster layer into the GeoPackage
+ Name this layer **MCDA_model.**

The MCDA_model should look like the screenshot below. White portions indicate suitable sites while black portions indicate non suitable sites.

![](img/28.jpg)

### <span style="text-decoration:underline">6.3 Vectorizing suitable sites</span>

Now we need to convert the MCDA_model raster layer into a vector.

+ From the top menu bar, select **Polygonize (Raster to Vector)**

The Polygonize (Raster to Vector) dialog window appears.

+ For Input Layer, select **MCDA_model** from the drop-down list.
+ For Name of the field to create, type **Sites.**
+ Keep the checkbox in front of Use 8-connectedness **uncheck**.

![](img/29.jpg)

+ Click on **Run** and close the window.
+ A temporary layer called **Vectorized** will be added to the layers panel. 
+ Open the attribute table of this Vectorized layer. 
+ Note that there is a column called Sites with values *0 and 1*.
+ *0* indicates not suitable while *1* indicates suitable.

![](img/30.jpg)

+ Click on **select by expression** and enter the following expression into the expression box.

![](img/31.jpg)

+ The sites which are 0 (not suitable) are selected. 
+ Click on the **Toggle Editing** Button.

![](img/32.jpg)

+ Click on **Delete Selected** to remove all the non suitable sites. 

![](img/33.jpg)

+ Export the layer into a GeoPackage.
+ Name this layer **AHP_suitability.**
+ The suitable sites are the polygons in green as shown in the image below. 

![](img/34.jpg)

Next, we will need to calculate the area of each polygon.

+ Use the **Field Calculator**
+ Output field name: **Site_area**
+ Output field type: **Decimal number (real)**
+ From the Geometry drop-down menu in the middle column, double click on **$area** to add to the expression pane. 

![](img/35.jpg)

+ Click on **OK.** Note that a new column will be added to the attribute table which includes all the areas of polygons in meters square.
+ However, we want the area to be in **Hectares**. To do this, repeat the above steps to create a new field called **area_hectares.**
+ For area_hectares, the expression should be **$area/10000** instead.

> The **attribute table** should look like this
