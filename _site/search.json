Consisting of a total of 17,508 islands, Indonesia is the fourth most populated country in the world with a population of 275.1 million people as of mid-2021. Additionally, it is the country with the largest Mulim population in the world, despite it not being an official Islamic state. The capital of Indonesia has been Jakarta since 1945. In 2019, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo announced that he plans to relocate the capital of Indonesia to the edge of eastern Borneo island, East Kalimantan. This is due to the fact that “the burden Jakarta is holding right now is too heavy as the centre of governance, business, finance, trade and services.” Jarkarta is one of the most densely populated cities in the world with a population of 10 million people. Due to the overcrowding, Jakarta experiences heavy traffic congestion leading to huge economic losses.\r\n2.0 Project Objective\r\nThis project aims to plan a new-province level city and to relocate the capital of Indonesia to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. This is in line with reducing the developmental inequality between java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago and to reduce Jakarta’s burden as Indonesia’s Primary hub. The proposed site of East Kalimantan, is near the regional cities, Balikpapan city and Samarinda city. It is also partly in the North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara Regencies. In East Kalimantan, more than 50% of the population is employed in the agriculture sector. Additionally, the manufacturing sector is dominated by industries such as logging and mining which has boosted the local economy. There are two airports in this area, one in Balikpapan which handles international flights and a smaller one in Samarinda which handles domestic flights. The president mentioned that the site of East Kalimantan is in a very favorable location as it is in a central location of Indonesia and it is close to urban areas. He also added that the area is at a low risk of natural disasters. Thus, we will be looking into East Kalimantan, specifically Balikpapan city, Samarinda city, North Penajam Paser regency and Kutai Kartanegara regency to propose a potential new site for the new capital of Indonesia.\r\nThe project aims to analyse the study area in terms of the following aspects:\r\nPopulation and demographic\r\nEconomic and Business\r\nTransport and Communication\r\nInfrastructure\r\nEnvironment and Hazard\r\nWe will also select a suitable site that meets the following requirements for capital relocation:\r\nThe proposed new capital city should be between 4500-5500 hectares in size.\r\nIt should avoid steep slope.
