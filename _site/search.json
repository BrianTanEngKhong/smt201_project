      "description": "Welcome to the home page of **Team 3 SMT201 Geographic Information Systems for Urban Planning** project website. \n\nThis project aims to plan a new-province level city and to relocate the capital of Indonesia to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. To achieve that, the proposed project aims to analyze the geographical layout of East Kalimantan to create a new province-level planned city. The goal of this strategy is to reduce developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago as well as to reduce Jakarta's burden as Indonesia's Primary hub. Our team will deploy a 2 pronge approach to this project. \n \n",
