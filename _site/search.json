The layers in the table in section 3.2 should be merged as they are from the 4 different folders.\r\nFrom the top menu bar, select Vector → Data Management Tools → Merge Vector Layers.\r\n\r\nUnder Input layers, click on the more icon at the end to select the layers in which you want to merge.\r\nFor destination CRS, select the project CRS (EPSG:23845)\r\nClick on Run.\r\nA temporary merged layer will be created.\r\nThe temporary layer should be clipped (section 2.3.4) to remove all unnecessary points and then saved into GeoPackage format.\r\n\r\nRepeat this process of merging for all the other necessary layers\r\n\r\n3.4 Clipping the various layers\r\nWe will be clipping the layers as mentioned above so that points outside of east_kalimantan will be cleaned away to keep only the points and polygons within our study area.\r\nFrom the top menu bar, click on Vector → Geoprocessing → Clip\r\n\r\nFor the Input layer, select from the drop down menu the layer in which we would like to clip. Note that all the layers merged in the previous section should be clipped.\r\nClick on the spanner beside the Input layer and select from the drop down menu Do not Filter (Better Performance).\r\n\r\nFor Limit features processed, select Not set\r\nFor Overlay layer, select east_kalimantan.\r\nClick on the spanner beside the Overlay layer and select from the drop down menu Do not Filter (Better Performance).\r\nGeopackage clipped layer and remove the temporary clipped layer and merged layers.\r\n\r\nRepeat this process of clipping for all the other necessary layers.\r\n\r\n4.0 Data cleaning\r\n4.1 Road network \r\nRight click on the layer roads_merged and open attribute table.\r\nSelect by expression the following roads: Jalan Arteri, Jalan Lokal, Jalan Kolektor.\r\n\r\nNext, save the selected features into the GeoPackage and name the layer connectingRoads.\r\n4.2 Airport buffer \r\nWe will first dissolve our airport polygon layer as we do not want to create multiple buffer for scenarios like this where there are 3 different polygons representing 1 airport\r\n\r\nGo to Vector → Geoprocessing Tools → Dissolve\r\nFor the input layer, we will select Airport\r\n\r\n\r\nClick on run\r\nWe will have a layer called ‘Dissolved’. Save it to the Geopackage and rename it as AirportDissolved\r\nNext, we want to create a buffer zone of 3.5km to airport for our accessibility to airport\r\nAccording to our research, a buffer zone of 3.5km from the airport zone will be used so as to minimize noise pollution in our proposed capital site.\r\nUsing the AirportDissolved layer, we will create a 3.5km buffer\r\nGo to Vector > Geoprocessing tools > Buffer\r\nFor the input layer, we will select AirportDissolved\r\nDistance will be 3500 meters or 3.5 kilometers is also acceptable\r\nSegments we will change to 100\r\nEnd cap style and Join style will be Round and Miter limit will be default at 2\r\n\r\n\r\nClick on Run\r\nA new layer called buffer will be created\r\nSave it to our Geopackage as AirportBuffer\r\n4.3 Hotspot heatmap \r\nFrom the top menu bar, select Processing → Toolbox → search for kernel density\r\nSelect Heatmap (Kernel Density Estimation)\r\n\r\nIn the Heatmap dialog window:\r\nPoint layer: hotspots_merged\r\nRadius will be 15000 meters\r\nX and Y size pixels = 100\r\n\r\nClick on Run and close the dialogue box.\r\nSave this into the GeoPackage as hotspots_heatmap.\r\nWe will now change the symbology of this layer to better visualise it.\r\nRight click on the layer and click on Properties → Symbology\r\nRender Type: Singleband Pseudocolour\r\nColour Ramp: Red\r\n\r\nThe map should look like the image below: \r\n\r\n5.0 Raster, proximity and slope\r\n5.1 Extracting raster data\r\nImport the DEM SRTM 30M KALIMANTAN TIMUR layer.\r\nFrom the menu bar, select Raster → Extraction → Clip Raster by Extent.\r\nFor Input layer, select DEM SRTM 30M KALIMANTAN TIMUR from the drop-down list.\r\nFor Clipping extent, click on the icon at the end of the option then select Calculate from Layer.\r\nSelect east_kalimantan from the drop-down list.\r\n\r\nClick on Run\r\nGeopackage the clipped raster\r\nMake sure to change Format to Geopackage in the drop down list.\r\nFor Layer name, call it DEM.\r\nUnder extent, click on the drop down list Calculate from Layer and Select east_kalimantan.\r\nSet resolution of 30m by 30m\r\n\r\nWhen we are ready, click on OK\r\n5.2 Creating attribute field for rastering\r\nAt the Layers panel, click on connectingRoads\r\nFrom the icon bar, click on the Open Attribute Table icon and click on Open field calculator\r\nFor Output field name, type POI_CODE\r\nAt the Expression pane, type 1\r\n\r\nClick on the OK button to run the function.\r\nA column called POI_CODE will be created.\r\n\r\n5.3 Rastering the layers\r\nFrom the menu bar, select Raster → Conversion → Rasterise (Vector to Raster)\r\nFor Input layer, select roads_merged from the drop-down list.\r\nFor Field to use for a burn-in value, select POI_CODE from the drop-down list.\r\nFor Output raster size units, select Georeferenced units.\r\nKeep both horizontal and vertical resolutions at 100 (meaning 100m by 100m resolution).\r\nFor Output extent, click on Calculate from Layer\r\nSelect DEM from the drop-down list.\r\n\r\nClick on the Run button.\r\nA temporary layer will be created.\r\nGeopackage the layer and call it connectingRoads_rasterized\r\n\r\nRepeat for the rest of the dataset giving the names to each of the layers as shown below:\r\n\r\nLayer to be rasterized\r\nFinal Layer Name\r\ndisaster_merged (Note that this layer is formed by merging the river

layers)\r\ndisaster_rasterized\r\nforest\r\nforest_rasterized\r\nseaport\r\nseaport_rasterized\r\nconnectingRoads\r\nconnectingRoads_rasterized\r\nAirportBuffer\r\nairport_rasterized\r\nsettlements\r\nsettlement_rasterized\r\n5.4 Proximity calculation\r\nFor the menu bar, select Raster → Analysis → Proximity (Raster Distance).\r\nFor Input layer, select roads_rasterized from the drop-down list.\r\nFor Distance units, select Georeferenced coordinates from the drop-down list.\r\nFor Output data type, select Float32 from the drop-down list.\r\n\r\nClick on the Run button.\r\nGeopackage the layer and name it connectingRoads_proximity\r\n\r\nRepeat for the rest of the dataset giving the names to each of the layers as shown below:\r\n\r\nLayer to do proximity\r\nFinal Layer Name\r\ndisaster_rasterized\r\ndisaster_proximity\r\nforest_rasterized\r\nforest_proximity\r\nseaport_rasterized\r\nseaport_proximity\r\nconnectingRoads_rasterized\r\nconnectingRoads_proximity\r\nairport_rasterized\r\nairport_proximity\r\nsettlement_rasterized\r\nsettlement_proximity\r\n5.5 Slope calculation\r\nFrom the menu bar, select Raster → Analysis → Slope.\r\nFor Input layer, select DEM_new from the drop-down list.\r\nClick on the Run button and Close the dialogue window.\r\nA temporary layer called Slope will be added.\r\nSet the resolution to 30m by 30m resolution.\r\nGeopackage layer and name it slope30by30\r\nTo ensure that our slope layer only covers the study area and not the sea boundaries, we will create a dissolve vector layer for the study area.\r\nFrom the top menu bar Vector → Geoprocessing Tool → Dissolve.\r\nInput layer select east_kalimantan.\r\nAdvanced options: Do not filter (Better performance).\r\n\r\nClick on the OK button.\r\nSave to Geopackage name it StudyAreaSingle.\r\nNext, we will clip raster by Mask Layer to get the raster layer of our slope in our study area\r\nFrom the top menu bar, select Raster → Extraction → Clip Raster by Mask Layer…\r\nInput layer: slope30by30\r\nMask layer: StudyAreaSingle\r\n\r\nClick on Run and close the window.\r\nSave the Clipped(mask) layer into GeoPackage and change the resolution to 100m by 100m.\r\nName it as slopeStudyArea.\r\n6.0 Choosing a suitable site\r\n6.1 Standardising the data using Z-Score\r\nWe will be using Raster calculator to standardise the proximity layers. The following Z-score equation is used for standardisation.\r\n\r\nTo get the minimum and maximum values used for standardisation, right click on the particular proximity layer, disaster_proxmity and navigate to the Information tab. The minimum and maximum values can be found there.\r\n\r\nFrom the top menu bar, click on Process → Toolbox\r\nA side pane will appear on the right.\r\nDouble click on Raster calculator.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse the standardisation equation as mentioned above and key it into the expression pane as shown in the image below.\r\n\r\n\r\nClick on the Run button and close the window\r\nExport the layer as a GeoPacakge and name it factor_disaster.\r\n\r\nRepeat this for all other proximity layersNote that for layers in which we want to be close to, we will inverse the standardisation using (1 - Zvalue). After standardizing, we save the respective results as:\r\n\r\nLayer to perform standardization\r\nInverse (1-Zscore)\r\nFinal Layer Name\r\ndisaster_proximity\r\nNo\r\nfactor_disaster_new\r\nforest_proximity\r\nNo\r\nfactor_forest\r\nhotspots_heatmap\r\nYes\r\nfactor_hotspot\r\nseaport_proximity\r\nYes\r\nfactor_seaport\r\nconnectingRoads_proximity\r\nYes\r\nfactor_connectingRoad\r\nairport_proximity\r\nYes\r\nfactor_airport\r\nslope\r\nYes\r\nfactor_slope\r\nsettlement_proximity\r\nYes\r\nfactor_settlement\r\n6.2 AHP calculation\r\nUsing the Raster calculator, we will now calculate the composite factor score using the following AHP importance ranking and weights. Our team achieved a consistency score of 4% and thus we will proceed with the following AHP weightage.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe created the AHP suitability layer with the following calculation:\r\n\r\n(“factor_disaster_new@1” * 0.327) + (“factor_forest@1”* 0.227) + (“factor_hotspot@1” * 0.157) + (“factor_seaport@1” * 0.108) + (“factor_connectingRoad@1” * 0.073) + (“factor_airport@1” * 0.05) + (“factor_slope@1” * 0.0340) + (“factor_settlement@1” * 0.024)\r\n\r\nOur reference layer will be any one of the factor layers that we have\r\nOutput CRS will be EPSG:23845 – DGN95/Indonesia TM-3 zone 54.1\r\n\r\nClick on Run and close the dialogue box after a new temporary layer is created.\r\nSave the temporary layer as a GeoPackage and name it AHP.\r\n\r\nFrom our analysis we decided that a composite factor score of 0.4 should be used as a cut-off for suitable sites. Now, we will use the function Reclassify by table to separate the sites into suitable and not suitable.\r\nFrom the Processing Toolbox, search for Reclassify by table and double click on it.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue box for Reclassify by table will appear.\r\nRaster layer: AHP\r\nClick on the more icon under Reclassification table and enter the following as shown below.\r\n\r\nClick OK to return to the previous screen\r\nFor range boundaries select: min <= value < max Your dialogue box should look like the screenshot below\r\n\r\nClick on Run and close the dialogue box.\r\nSave this temporary Reclassified raster layer into the GeoPackage\r\nName this layer MCDA_model.\r\nThe MCDA_model should look like the screenshot below. White portions indicate suitable sites while black portions indicate non suitable sites.\r\n\r\n6.3 Vectorizing suitable sites\r\nNow we need to convert the MCDA_model raster layer into a vector.\r\nFrom the top menu bar, select Polygonize (Raster to Vector)\r\nThe Polygonize (Raster to Vector) dialog window appears.\r\nFor Input Layer, select MCDA_model from the drop-down list.\r\nFor Name of the field to create, type Sites.\r\nKeep the checkbox in front of Use 8-connectedness uncheck.\r\n\r\nClick on Run and close the window.\r\nA temporary layer called Vectorized will be added to the layers panel.\r\nOpen the attribute table of this Vectorized layer.\r\nNote that there is a column called Sites with values 0 and 1.\r\n0 indicates not suitable while 1 indicates suitable.\r\n\r\nClick on select by expression and enter the following expression into the expression box.\r\n\r\nThe sites which are 0 (not suitable) are selected.\r\nClick on the Toggle Editing Button.\r\n\r\nClick on Delete Selected to remove all the non suitable sites.\r\n\r\nExport the layer into a GeoPackage.\r\nName this layer AHP_suitability.\r\nThe suitable sites are the polygons in green as shown in the image below.\r\n\r\nNext, we will need to calculate the area of each polygon.\r\nUse the Field Calculator\r\nOutput field name: Site_area\r\nOutput field type: Decimal number (real)\r\nFrom the Geometry drop-down menu in the middle column, double click on $area to add to the expression pane.\r\n\r\nClick on OK. Note that a new column will be added to the attribute table which includes all the areas of polygons in meters square.\r\nHowever, we want the area to be in Hectares. To do this, repeat the above steps to create a new field called area_hectares.\r\nFor area_hectares, the expression should be $area/10000 instead.\r\n\r\nThe attribute table should look like this\r\n\r\n\r\n7.0 Geopackaged Layers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Consisting of a total of 17,508 islands, Indonesia is the fourth most populated country in the world with a population of 275.1 million people as of mid-2021. Additionally, it is the country with the largest Mulim population in the world, despite it not being an official Islamic state. The capital of Indonesia has been Jakarta since 1945. In 2019, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo announced that he plans to relocate the capital of Indonesia to the edge of eastern Borneo island, East Kalimantan. This is due to the fact that “the burden Jakarta is holding right now is too heavy as the centre of governance, business, finance, trade and services.” Jarkarta is one of the most densely populated cities in the world with a population of 10 million people. Due to the overcrowding, Jakarta experiences heavy traffic congestion leading to huge economic losses.\r\n2.0 Project Objective\r\nThis project aims to plan a new-province level city and to relocate the capital of Indonesia to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. This is in line with reducing the developmental inequality between java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago and to reduce Jakarta’s burden as Indonesia’s Primary hub. The proposed site of East Kalimantan, is near the regional cities, Balikpapan city and Samarinda city. It is also partly in the North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara Regencies. In East Kalimantan, more than 50% of the population is employed in the agriculture sector. Additionally, the manufacturing sector is dominated by industries such as logging and mining which has boosted the local economy. There are two airports in this area, one in Balikpapan which handles international flights and a smaller one in Samarinda which handles domestic flights. The president mentioned that the site of East Kalimantan is in a very favorable location as it is in a central location of Indonesia and it is close to urban areas. He also added that the area is at a low risk of natural disasters. Thus, we will be looking into East Kalimantan, specifically Balikpapan city, Samarinda city, North Penajam Paser regency and Kutai Kartanegara regency to propose a potential new site for the new capital of Indonesia.\r\nThe project aims to analyse the study area in terms of the following aspects:\r\nPopulation and demographic\r\nEconomic and Business\r\nTransport and Communication\r\nInfrastructure\r\nEnvironment and Hazard\r\nWe will also select a suitable site that meets the following requirements for capital relocation:\r\nThe proposed new capital city should be between 4500-5500 hectares in size.\r\nIt should avoid steep slope. Steep slope developments are relative more costly because they involve cut-and-fill and is less environmental friendly.\r\nIt should be away from potential natural disaster risk areas such as sea coasts, major rivers and volcanoes.\r\nIt should be near to current urban settlement areas but not at the current major settlement areas.\r\nIt should avoid natural forest as much as possible.\r\nIt should avoid areas prone to forest fire.\r\nIt should be highly accessible via road transport.\r\nIt should be near to airport(s) and seaport(s).\r\n3.0 Project Schedule\r\n\r\n4.0 Data Sources\r\nData Source\r\nName\r\nDescription\r\nLink\r\nIndonesia Geospatial\r\nBATAS DESA DESEMBER 2019 DUKCAPIL KALIMANTAN TIMUR\r\nVillage boundary and population data for East Kalimantan 2019\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/04/download-shapefile-shp-batas-desa.html\r\nIndonesia Geospatial\r\nGeology Kalimantan Timur\r\nGeology Shapefile of East Kalimantan\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/03/download-data-shapefile-shp-geologi-se.html\r\nIndonesia Geospatial\r\nKOTA BALIKPAPAN\r\nTopographical data layers of Balikpapan City\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/shp-rbi-provinsi-kalimantan-timur.html\r\nIndonesia Geospatial\r\nKOTA SAMARINDA\r\nTopographical data layers of Samarinda City\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/shp-rbi-provinsi-kalimantan-timur.html\r\nIndonesia Geospatial\r\nKUTAI KARTANEGARA\r\nTopographical data layers of Kutai Kartanegara Regency\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/shp-rbi-provinsi-kalimantan-timur.html\r\nIndonesia Geospatial\r\nOSM Buildings\r\nDetailed building footprints throughout Indonesia\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/12/download-shp-pemukiman-detail-seluruh.html\r\nIndonesia Geospatial\r\nPENAJAM PASER UTARA\r\nTopographical data layers of Penajam Paser Regency\r\nhttps://www.indonesia-geospasial.com/2020/01/shp-rbi-provinsi-kalimantan-timur.html\r\nIndonesia Geospatial\r\n30.

Additionally, Jakarta is strained being the sole primary hub.\r\n\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\nTo reduce the developmental inequality and Jakarta’s burden as Indonesia’s primary hub, we carry out suitable analyses to locate a new province-level planned city.\r\n\r\n\r\nApproach\r\nIsolate study area from East Kalimantan\r\nSelect relevant factors (report of survey) for consideration\r\nRasterize and vectorize relevant factors\r\nPerform AHP analysis\r\nSelect most relevant site from results\r\n\r\n\r\nStudy area\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTransport & comuunication\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHighest concentration of major roads are found within Balikpapan city and Samarinda city which indicates these cities have a larger concentration of transportation facilities as compared to the regencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n The different modes of transportations, airports, seaports and bus terminals are mostly situated within or near Balikpapan city and Samarinda city.\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulation & demographic\r\n\r\n\r\n This group of people is vital for national progression as they are working individuals. Darker shaded areas have a denser population. This is well explained as Samarinda and Balikpapan are both city centers, signifying more job opportunities for career advancement.\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic & business\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dataset contains coal mining, surface mining and other mining. Land used from mining activities could be a consideration when selecting the area for the city as it would involve additional economic cost to rehabilitate lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfrastructure\r\n\r\n\r\n These are essential services as they prevent diseases, improve wellbeing and quality of life for citizens. Choosing a site nearer to polygons with more healthcare facilities will be ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n Educational institutions are not evenly distributed. Kota Samarinda and the coastline of Kota Balikpapan are densely populated with educational institutions. This might be due to the higher population density in those areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n Electrical towers are not evenly spread out. This could be due to the fact that Kota Samarinda is the capital, and more modern buildings are located there.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment & hazard\r\n\r\n\r\n It is observed that hotspot points are consistently scattered throughout the whole study area. When choosing the capital area, we should avoid these spots as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n Climate change is a real problem, we should preserve forests as and when we can. By choosing a site that is far from forests, it reduces the need for deforestation, thus preserving the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n Tsunamis are prevalent in Indonesia. By avoiding coastlines, we are mitigating the chances of high casualties and fatalities should a tsunami take place.\r\n\r\n\r\nSite selection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter standardizing and rasterizing with the z-formula below, we created an AHP site suitability layer with the AHP values with a consistency check of 4%.\r\n\\[\r\nz = \r\n\\frac{x - min(x)}{max(x) - min(x)}\r\n\\]\r\nWe continued to narrow down the sites from AHP suitability layer by selecting sites that meet the 4500 to 5500 hectare requirement, and we were left with 2 sites to choose from. The following comparison table shows our thought process for evaluating the 2 sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince site 1 has more highlighted boxes, it shows that site 1 is more favourable. Hence, our chosen site.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture work\r\nQGIS has proven to be a powerful and cost effective application for analysts. With many plugins in their repository, we are able to manipulate data and produce web pages for professional use.\r\nNarrowing down such a huge map to several sites has been challenging. It is important to first identify constraints and limitations when performing map study. We could have also analysed additional factors such as gross domestic product (GDP) and potential business ventures that Indonesia can undertake to make sure their new province thrives. For instance, by planning out what new activities the selected site could do will create clear goals when building its infrastructure.\r\nAs our AHP consistency score is 4%, we could have tried out more AHP permutations to get an even lower consistency score. This would provide us even more suitable sites for analysis.\r\nAdditionally, it would be good if we were able to get external help from someone fluent in Bahasa Indonesia. As attributes in the data are mainly in that language, we were unable to translate all attributes accurately due to the language barrier. Therefore, there might be minor inconsistencies as we might have missed a few layers, which might have affected the final AHP site suitability results.\r\nIn future, we hope that the skills we gained from Geographic Information Systems for Urban Planning will be put to good use, so that we can derive deeper insights for better urban planning and analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep calm and Kali(mantan) on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(function () {\r\nvar script = document.createElement(\"script\");\r\nscript.type = \"text/javascript\";\r\nvar src = \"true\";\r\nif (src === \"\" || src === \"true\") src = \"https://mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML\";\r\nif (location.protocol !== \"file:\" && /^https?:/.test(src))\r\nsrc = src.replace(/^https?:/, '');\r\nscript.src = src;\r\ndocument.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(script);\r\n})();\r\n",

Upon analysis, we found out that there were no volcanoes within our study area as indicated in the image above. Therefore, the study area is safe from volcanic hazards and activity.\r\n1.2 AHP Analysis\r\nBefore performing site selection, we will have to first conduct Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) analysis to determine which criterias should be prioritized for decision making.\r\nBy keeping the following goal in mind, we will explain our reasons for choosing the weightings for each criteria.\r\nGoal: To create a new province-level planned city, and the capital will be relocated to a more central location within Indonesia. The plan is part of a strategy to reduce developmental inequality between Java and other islands in the Indonesian archipelago and to reduce Jakarta’s burden as Indonesia’s primary hub.\r\nA primary hub is defined as a main hub for airlines. By operating an additional hub, it will take away the pressure from Jakarta being the sole primary hub in Indonesia. The implementation of a new hub will bring in more business to Indonesia, boosting tourism and export sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: AHP scores\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Pairwise comparison matrix\r\n\r\nWe set n = 8 for the number of factors to be used in our AHP calculation and ranked these factors in decreasing order of importance. The final consistency showed a result of 4% which we thought was a suitable score. We used these values to compute the AHP site suitability layer in our QGIS project. Additionally, we took into account the amount of data we have for each of the factors, as a lack of data will not produce an accurate site suitability result. We will now justify why we think each factor should be ranked as so. The factors and our respective rankings are:\r\n\r\nNatural Disaster\r\n\r\nSince the main goal of choosing a site is to create a new province-level city, we feel the most important factor for consideration is safety since many people will be visiting or permanently staying in this area. Should there be any natural catastrophes, casualties will be high.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will be analysing this by looking at fire hotspots, coastlines and rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForest\r\n\r\nIf the chosen area is near forests, a lot of land pre-planning will need to be done. Especially in a time where global warming is a real issue, we should not support more deforestation for industrial purposes. To preserve the environment, we should select areas that are more barren.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will analyse this by comparing site areas with OpenStreetMap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForest fire\r\n\r\nForest fire can also be seen as a type of natural disaster. However, it is more predictable. It can be gauged through ambient temperatures. It is still very dangerous as the fumes resulting from forest fires can negatively impact the health of citizens. It also kills off the flora and fauna. We also have many data points on forest fires, which is why we think that ranking it first will be significant, as we need to avoid hotspot points.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will be analysing this through forest hotspots from our datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeaport\r\n\r\nIndonesia is the world’s largest exporter of mining resources. Therefore, we conclude it is more important than airports since mining resources are generally transported with cargo ships. An article reported that “With exports of oil, gas and coal steadily increasing, the province was responsible for a major portion of the country’s export output with a value of US$37.97 billion. As of October 2012, its export output value stood at $27.71 billion.” Furthermore, Balikpapan is labelled as “a seaport city on the east coast of East Kalimantan,” meaning that they rely more heavily on seaports. (Indonesia - Insights, n.d.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will analyse this through rasterized points of seaports. This is because we lack the polygon representation of seaport polygons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad transport\r\n\r\nWe ranked this after airport/seaport because airports and seaports help connect Indonesia to the world. Road transport is more so for domestic travelling purposes. It is still important as citizens need to be able to efficiently move within the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will be analysing this through the rasterized layer for road transport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAirport\r\n\r\nAirports are still important because they bring in tourists to Indonesia. This boosts Indonesia’s economy. Additionally, they can also be used to export sensitive and perishable goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will analyse this through rasterized polygons for airports. Polygons are more accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlope\r\n\r\nAlthough it is important to note that our selected site should avoid steep slopes due to higher development cost from the involvement of more cut-and-fill, we felt that slope does not outweigh the above mentioned factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will analyse this using the slope layer that we created so that we can analyze steep slope areas to avoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSettlement\r\n\r\nBy planning a provincial area, many people would flock to this area to live since it is accessible. Hence, a suitable area would be one near current urban settlement areas and not major ones which are already densely populated.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will be analysing this through the use of a choropleth map created with population attributes. Additionally, we will cross reference with Indonesia’s OpenStreetMap to analyze the complexity of buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3 Narrowing down the suitable sites\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Suitable sites\r\n\r\nAfter performing AHP analysis, we have derived a layer with suitable sites highlighted in green as shown in figure 25. To narrow down these areas, we first check if each of these suitable sites meet the size requirements. As we have calculated the area of each of these polygons in hectares, we can simply use the identify tool to confirm whether or not the polygons are within 4500 to 5500 hectares.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Selecting polygons with appropriate size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Polygons with appropriate size\r\n\r\nBy using the select expression function, we can key in the following to determine which polygons meet the size criteria. As seen in figure 6, we have narrowed down the suitable sites to just 2 locations. For simplicity purposes, we will be calling the site on the far left “1” and the site on the far right “2”.\r\n1.4 Comparing the sites\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Sites and natural disaster\r\n\r\nWhile both sites are relatively far away and safe from fire hotspots, site 1 is more preferable as it is away from the coastlines and rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Sites and forests\r\n\r\nBoth sites are far away from forests. However, site 2 has more forest surrounding it. This may mean that the forests have to be cleared to improve accessibility to that area. Therefore, site 1 is more favourable.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9: Sites and hotspots\r\n\r\nFrom Figure 9, Both sites are safe from fire hotspots as they are far away from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10: Sites and seaports\r\n\r\nFrom Figure 10, Site 2 is more favourable as it is nearer to seaports. This allows for more efficient transportation as workers in site 2 will not have to travel as much to get to seaports.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11: Sites and road transport\r\n\r\nFrom Figure 11, the lines in red show connecting roads for East Kalimantan. Site 2 does not have any connecting roads leading to it, which makes it inaccessible. This might also be due to the face that the entrance to site 2 is blocked by forests as shown in figure 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12: Sites and road transport\r\n\r\nBoth sites are not very near to the airport points. However, because site 2 does not have connecting roads, it makes it even more difficult to access airports. Therefore, site 1 is preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13: Sites and slope\r\n\r\nFrom Figure 13, White areas represent steeper slopes compared to darker areas. Based on this map, site 2 is more preferred because it has a gentler slope. Places with steeper slopes result in higher development cost due to the cut and fill.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 14: Sites and settlements\r\n\r\nAs part of the requirements, the site should be near urban settlement areas but not located directly at major settlement areas. This is true for both sites as they are not currently in highly populated areas. However, in terms of accessibility, site 1 is preferred as it has connecting roads, making it nearer to current settlement areas as compared to site 2. The ease of access thereby makes site 1 “nearer” to these settlements.\r\n1.5 Site overview and conclusion\r\nThe table below shows our thought process. By comparing both sites with each attribute, we are able to find the most optimal solution.The underlined column represent the site with the more preferred characteristic.\r\nSite\r\n1\r\n2\r\nNatural disaster\r\nFar away from coastline and rivers\r\nCloser to coastline and rivers\r\nForest\r\nNo forest blocking entrance to the area \r\nForest blocking entrance to area\r\nForest fire\r\nFar away from hotspots \r\nFar away from hotspots \r\nSeaport\r\nFurther from seaports\r\nNearer to seaports \r\nRoad transport\r\nMore accessible \r\nLess accessible\r\nAirport\r\nMore accessible to airports \r\nLess accessible to airports\r\nSlope\r\nSteeper slope\r\nGentler slope \r\nSettlement\r\nNearer to settlement areas \r\nFurther from settlement areas\r\nSize\r\n 5452 hectares \r\n5373 hectares\r\nTotal Underlined\r\n7\r\n3\r\nApart from size, all other factors in the table are ranked in order of decreasing weight as per our AHP analysis. Hence, attributes higher up should be prioritized for consideration. For example, even though site 2 has a gentler slope, selecting site 2 will lead to tradeoffs such as lower accessibility and higher chances of fatalities due to it being prone to natural disasters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 15: Final selected site\r\n\r\nIn totality, site 1 has 7 preferred attributes while site 2 only has 3. Therefore, site 1 is our chosen site as shown in figure 36.\r\n1.5 Future Work and Conclusion\r\nQGIS has proven to be a powerful and cost effective application for analysts. With many plugins in their repository, we are able to manipulate data and produce web pages for professional use.\r\nNarrowing down such a huge map to several sites has been challenging. It is important to first identify constraints and limitations when performing map study. We could have also analysed additional factors such as gross domestic product (GDP) and potential business ventures that Indonesia can undertake to make sure their new province thrives. For instance, by planning out what new activities the selected site could do will create clear goals when building its infrastructure.\r\nAs our AHP consistency score is 4%, we could have tried out more AHP permutations to get an even lower consistency score. This would provide us even more suitable sites for analysis.\r\nAdditionally, it would be good if we were able to get external help from someone fluent in Bahasa Indonesia. As attributes in the data are mainly in that language, we were unable to translate all attributes due to the language barrier. Therefore, there might be minor inconsistencies as we might have missed a few layers, which might have affected the final AHP site suitability results.\r\nIn future, we hope that the skills we gained from Geographic Information Systems for Urban Planning will be put to good use, so that we can derive deeper insights for better urban planning and analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Thus, using the data found in Balikpapan city, Samarinda city, North Penajam Paser regency and Kutai Kartanegara regency, we merge them altogether to map out our population density choropleth map. One interesting finding was that in city sub-districts such as Samarinda and Balikpapan, the population density tends to be higher, between 2324 to 28047 per sub district boundary. Contrastingly, we see a smaller population density across most of North Penajam Paser regency and Kutai Kartanegara regency sub-districts.\r\n1.1.2 Gender Distribution\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Male Demographics Distribution along study area\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Female Demographics Distribution along study area\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Gender Distribution along study area\r\n\r\nFrom Figures 3, 4 and 5 above, we observed that the distribution of male to female in our study area remains somewhat equal with both showing the same gender distribution. One notable difference between figure 3 and 4 is that in Cities like Samarinda and Balikpapan, there is a higher concentration of males and females which further substantiates our earlier discussion that population density is higher in city subdistricts.\r\n1.1.3 Distribution by age\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6a: Distribution of Adults aged 20-59 along study area\r\n\r\nFrom the choropleth map shown in Figure 6a, we observed that a large proportion of adults are heavily concentrated around city centres like Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan. This group of people is representative in terms of job opportunities and advancement for that particular state. We know that there are more job opportunities available in city centers which explains the higher representation of population in both Samarinda and Balikpapan. Furthermore, we also observed that the adult population across the Kutai Kartanegara Regency and Penajam North Paser Regency are significantly less concentrated as some of those areas are heavily related to agricultural activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6b: Distribution of Senior Citizens aged 60 and above along study area\r\n\r\nFrom the choropleth map shown in Figure 6b, we observed a similar trend where senior citizens aged 60 and above are heavily concentrated around city centres like Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan. This can be attributed to reasons such as proximity to healthcare facilities, where healthcare facilities are more accessible in city centres as compared to the outskirts of the study area. In figure 6b above, we observed that hospitals are mostly situated in Samarinda and Balikpapan city, and there is a lack of healthcare facilities found in Kutai Kartanegara Regency and PenajamNorthPaser Regency. Thus, this relationship between proximity to hospital facilities and population within the senior citizens demographics are highly correlated.\r\n1.2 Economic and Businesses\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: East Kalimantan GDP distribution by sector (Statista Research Department, 2020)\r\n\r\nIndonesia is the largest palm oil producer in the world, while its forests make up the third largest tropical forests in the world. Additionally, Indonesia ranks among the world’s top 10 coal and mining producers. In East Kalimantan, the key economic contribution to its GDP is attributed to the likes of agriculture, mining and manufacturing which we will comprehensively share in the upcoming part of the report.\r\n1.2.1 Agriculture\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8a: Agriculture Distribution over study area\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8b: Breakdown of Agriculture Distribution over study area\r\n\r\nFigure 8a and 8b above illustrate the distribution of agricultural activities around the study area of Balikpapan City, Samarinda City, Kutai Kartanegara Regency and Penajam North Paser Regency. As Indonesia is known as the largest palm oil producer in the world, it is no surprise that we are seeing plantations forming the bulk of agriculture activities in the study area. Most of these plantations region constitutes commodities production such as palm oil and rubber which contributes most to Indonesia exports and GDP.\r\nFood crops are cultivated in three categories of arable land in Indonesia, Sawah (wet-land), Tegalan (dry-land) and Ladang (garden/bare land/shifting land). Sawah is flat lowland on downhill sites or floodplains and terraced land on upper slopes. Tegalan is gently sloping land, which has no access to any irrigation system and usually located close to settlement, whereas ladang is slope land of varying steepness and altitude. Tegalan and Ladang are considered to be marginal land.\r\nThe agrifield layer represents Tegalan(dry-land) and Ladang (garden/bare land/ shifting land) which are known to be marginal land that has little or no agricultural or industrial value. We observed that agrifield is concentrated in Balikpapan, Samarinda and Kutai Kartanegara.\r\nThe rice field layer represents Sawah(wet-land) which contributes to part of East Kalimantan rice production. We observed that ricefield is more commonly dispersed around the north western site of the study area as well as a smaller proportion within Samarinda City.\r\n1.2.2 Mining\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9: Coal Mining points and Other Mining points in study area\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10: Surface Mining regions in study area\r\n\r\nIn East Kalimantan, mining contributes to the largest proportion in terms of GDP. From the data relating to mining that we found in our dataset, we classify them further into 3 categories which comprises Coal Mining, Other Mining and Surface Mining. We noticed that Coal Mining and other types of mining is apparent only in the Kutai Kartanegara Regency. For Surface Mining, it is only observed in the outskirts of Samarinda city and along the south-east region of Kutai Kartanegara Regency. In the study area of Penjamin Paser Utara and Balikpapan, there seems to be a lack of such land use in surface mining. Land used from mining activities could be a consideration when selecting the area for the city as it would involve additional economic cost to rehabilitate lands.\r\n1.2.3 Manufacturing\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11: Manufacturing points in study area\r\n\r\nFor Figure 11, it represents the manufacturing geolocation found in our study area. We observed that Balikpapan City is more reliant on manufacturing in their economy as there are more manufacturing sites observed.\r\nTo conclude, with reference to the Agriculture layer and Industry layer which we further classify them, we are able to further understand the region’s key economic sectors in the field of agriculture, mining and manufacturing. These are key considerations in allowing us to effectively find a suitable site for choosing a capital.\r\n1.3 Transport and Communication\r\n1.3.1 Airports, Seaports and Bus Terminals\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12: Distribution of Transportation services in East Kalimantan\r\n\r\nFigure 12 illustrates the distribution of different transportation services in our study area. There are only two airports, one within Balikpapan city and the other in Penajam North Paser regency, just outside of Samarinda city. The seaports are mostly situated within or just outside of Balikpapan city and Samarinda city. Similarly, the bus terminals are also found close to Balikpapan city and Samarinda city. Collectively, the different modes of transportations are mostly situated within or near Balikpapan city and Samarinda city. Even though there are transportation services found in Penajam North Paser regency and Kutai Kartanegara regency, those services are mainly located at the edges of the two cities. This shows that most of the transportation services are found in a close vicinity to the cities.\r\n1.3.2 Roads\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13a: Distribution of all Roads in East Kalimantan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13b: Distribution of Main Roads in East Kalimantan\r\n\r\nThis map in Figure 13a and 13b shows the distribution of road networks in East Kalimantan. From the above map, we can observe that the highest concentration of roads are found within Balikpapan city and Samarinda city. This further indicates that the cities have a higher concentration of transportation facilities as compared to the regencies.\r\n1.3.3 Phone Towers\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 14: Distribution of Phone Towers in Our Study Area\r\n\r\nFigure 14 shows the distribution of phone towers in our study area. There is a large concentration of phone towers in Samarinda. Phone towers are electronic wireless equipment that allows the surrounding area to utilize wireless devices such as radios and cell phones. The distribution of phone towers indicates good connectivity between the different regions, allowing for good communication.\r\n1.4 Transport and Communication\r\n1.4.1 Electricity towers and power\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 15: Distribution of Electrical Towers in Our Study Area\r\n\r\nElectrical points are more prominent in Kota Samarinda and Kutai Kartanegara.These facilities provide infrastructure to further develop the country. It can be observed that the distribution of electrical towers are not evenly spread out as most of them are located in Kota Samarinda. This could be due to the fact that Kota Samarinda is the capital of East Kalimantan, and more modern buildings are located there.\r\n1.4.2 Hospitals and healthcare services\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 16: Distribution of hospitals and healthcare services\r\n\r\nFigure 16 shows the distribution of hospitals and healthcare services. Hospitals are symbolised with a red cross while healthcare services are symbolised with a blue point. These are essential services as they prevent diseases, improve wellbeing and quality of life for citizens. However, we can see that some areas do not have access to any healthcare services as the points are sparsely scattered. On the other hand, we observed that most hospitals are situated within Balikpapan city and Samarinda city. Therefore, choosing a site nearer to areas with many healthcare facilities will be ideal.\r\n1.4.3 Educational institutions\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 17: Distribution of educational institutions\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Kota Samarinda and the coastline of Kota Balikpapan are densely populated with educational institutions. They are not evenly distributed. This might be due to the fact that Kota Samarinda and Kota Balikpapan have a higher population density.\r\n1.5 Environment and Hazard\r\nWe will be looking at fire hotspots, rivers, coastlines and forests to evaluate the environment and its hazards.\r\n1.5.1 Fire hotspots\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 18: Distribution of fire hotspots \r\n\r\nAfter clipping fire hotspot data to the study area, it is observed that hotspot points are consistently scattered throughout the whole study area except Loa Kulu and Sepaku (extreme left of study area). It can also be observed in Figure 18 that the top most section of the study area is the most densely populated with fire hotspots. Therefore, when choosing the capital area, we should avoid hazardous portions of the study area.\r\n1.5.2 Rivers\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 19: Distribution of rivers\r\n\r\nRivers run through the 4 regions. As it was mentioned in task 2 that our area should avoid major rivers, we took this into consideration. However, it is quite obvious that rivers are very prominent throughout the whole of East Kalimantan.\r\n1.5.3 Coastlines\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 20: Distribution of coastlines\r\n\r\nIt was also mentioned in task 2 that coastlines should be avoided when choosing a site as it could pose risks resulting from natural disaster. Indonesia For instance, tsunamis occur in Indonesia. By avoiding coastlines, we are mitigating the chances of high casualties and fatalities should a tsunami take place.\r\n1.5.4 Forest\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 21: Distribution of forests\r\n\r\nTask 2 mentioned that the new area should avoid natural forests. Figure 21 shows the distribution of forests. In this day and age where climate change is a real problem, we should preserve forests as and when we can. By choosing a site that is far from forests, it reduces the need for deforestation, thus preserving the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
